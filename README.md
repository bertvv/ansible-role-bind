# Ansible role `bind`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bertvv/ansible-role-bind.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bertvv/ansible-role-bind)

An Ansible role for setting up BIND ISC as an **authoritative-only** DNS server for multiple domains on EL7 or Ubuntu Server. Specifically, the responsibilities of this role are to:

- install BIND
- set up the main configuration file
    - master server
    - slave server
- set up forward and reverse lookup zone files

This role supports multiple forward and reverse zones, including for IPv6. Although enabling recursion is supported (albeit *strongly* discouraged), consider using another role if you want to set up a caching or forwarding name server.

Configuring the firewall is not a concern of this role, so you should do this using another role (e.g. [bertvv.rh-base](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/rh-base/)).

If you like/use this role, please consider giving it a star. Thanks!

See the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) for notable changes between versions.

## Requirements

- **The package `python-ipaddr` should be installed on the management node** (since v3.7.0)

## Role Variables

Variables are not required, unless specified.

| Variable                     | Default              | Comments (type)                                                                                                              |

† Best practice for an authoritative name server is to leave recursion turned off. However, [for some cases](http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch7/queries.html#allow-query-cache) it may be necessary to have recursion turned on.

### Minimal variables for a working zone

Even though only variable `bind_zone_master_server_ip` is required for the role to run without errors, this is not sufficient to get a working zone. In order to set up an authoritative name server that is available to clients, you should also at least define the following variables:

| Variable                     | Master | Slave |
| :---                         | :---:  | :---: |
| `bind_zone_domains`          | V      | V     |
| `  - name`                   | V      | V     |
| `  - networks`               | V      | --    |
| `  - name_servers`           | V      | --    |
| `  - hosts`                  | V      | --    |
| `bind_listen_ipv4`           | V      | V     |
| `bind_allow_query`           | V      | V     |

### Domain definitions

```Yaml
bind_zone_domains:
  - name: mydomain.com
    hosts:
      - name: pub01
        ip: 192.0.2.1
        ipv6: 2001:db8::1
        aliases:
          - ns
      - name: '@'
        ip:
          - 192.0.2.2
          - 192.0.2.3
        sshfp:
          - "3 1 1262006f9a45bb36b1aa14f45f354b694b77d7c3"
          - "3 2 e5921564252fe10d2dbafeb243733ed8b1d165b8fa6d5a0e29198e5793f0623b"
        ipv6:
          - 2001:db8::2
          - 2001:db8::3
        aliases:
          - www
      - name: priv01
        ip: 10.0.0.1
      - name: mydomain.net.
        aliases:
          - name: sub01
            type: DNAME
    networks:
      - '192.0.2'
      - '10'
      - '172.16'
    delegate:
      - zone: foo
        dns: 192.0.2.1
    services:
      - name: _ldap._tcp
        weight: 100
        port: 88
        target: dc001
    naptr:
      - name: "sip"
        order: 100
        pref: 10
        flags: "S"
        service: "SIP+D2T"
        regex: "!^.*$!sip:customer-service@example.com!"
        replacement: "_sip._tcp.example.com."
```

### Minimal slave configuration

```Yaml
    bind_listen_ipv4: ['any']
    bind_allow_query: ['any']
    bind_zone_master_server_ip: 192.168.111.222
    bind_zone_domains:
      - name: example.com
```

### Hosts

Host names that this DNS server should resolve can be specified in `hosts` as a list of dicts with fields `name`, `ip`,  `aliases` and `sshfp`. Aliases can be CNAME (default) or DNAME records.

To allow to surf to http://example.com/, set the host name of your web server to `'@'` (must be quoted!). In BIND syntax, `@` indicates the domain name itself.

If you want to specify multiple IP addresses for a host, add entries to `bind_zone_hosts` with the same name (e.g. `priv01` in the code snippet). This results in multiple A/AAAA records for that host and allows [DNS round robin](http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch9/rr.html), a simple load balancing technique. The order in which the IP addresses are returned can be configured with role variable `bind_rrset_order`.

### Networks

As you can see, not all hosts are in the same network. This is perfectly acceptable, and supported by this role. All networks should be specified in `networks` (part of bind_zone_domains.name dict), though, or the host will not get a PTR record for reverse lookup:

Remark that only the network part should be specified here! When specifying a class B IP address (e.g. "172.16") in a variable file, it must be quoted. Otherwise, the Yaml parser will interpret it as a float.

Based on the idea and examples detailed at <https://linuxmonk.ch/wordpress/index.php/2016/managing-dns-zones-with-ansible/> for the gdnsd package, the zonefiles are fully idempotent, and thus only get updated if "real" content changes.

### Zone delgation

To delegate a zone to a DNS, it is enough to create a `NS` record (under delegate) which is the equivalent of:

```
foo IN NS 192.0.2.1
```

### Service records

Service (SRV) records can be added with the services. This should be a list of dicts with mandatory fields `name` (service name), `target` (host providing the service), `port` (TCP/UDP port of the service) and optional fields `priority` (default = 0) and `weight` (default = 0).

### ACLs

ACLs can be defined like this:

```Yaml
bind_acls:
  - name: acl1
    match_list:
      - 192.0.2.0/24
      - 10.0.0.0/8
```

The names of the ACLs will be added to the `allow-transfer` clause in global options.

### Binding Keys

Binding keys can be defined like this:

```Yaml
bind_dns_keys:
  - name: master_key
    algorithm: hmac-sha256
    secret: "azertyAZERTY123456"
bind_extra_include_files:
  - /etc/bind/auth_transfer.conf
```

This will be set in a file */etc/bind/auth_transfer.conf* which have to be added in the list variable **bind_extra_include_files**

## Dependencies

No dependencies. If you want to configure the firewall, do this through another role (e.g. [bertvv.rh-base](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/rh-base)).

## Example Playbook

See the test playbook [test.yml](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-bind/blob/docker-tests/test.yml) for an elaborate example that showcases most features.

## Testing

There are two test environments for this role, one based on Vagrant, the other on Docker. The latter powers the Travis-CI tests. The tests are kept in a separate (orphan) branch so as not to clutter the actual code of the role. [git-worktree(1)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) is used to include the test code into the working directory. Remark that this requires at least Git v2.5.0.

### Running Docker tests

1. Fetch the test branch: `git fetch origin docker-tests`
2. Create a Git worktree for the test code: `git worktree add docker-tests docker-tests`. This will create a directory `docker-tests/`

The script `docker-tests.sh` will create a Docker container, and apply this role from a playbook `test.yml`. The Docker images are configured for testing Ansible roles and are published at <https://hub.docker.com/r/bertvv/ansible-testing/>. There are images available for several distributions and versions. The distribution and version should be specified outside the script using environment variables:

```
DISTRIBUTION=centos VERSION=7 ./docker-tests/docker-tests.sh
```

The specific combinations of distributions and versions that are supported by this role are specified in `.travis.yml`.

The first time the test script is run, a container will be created that is assigned the IP address 172.17.0.2. This will be the master DNS-server. The server is still running after the script finishes and can be queried from the command line, e.g.:

```
$ dig @172.17.0.2 www.acme-inc.com +short
srv001.acme-inc.com.
172.17.1.1
```

If you run the script again, a new container is launched with IP address 172.17.0.3 that will be set up as a slave DNS-server. After a few seconds, it will have received updates from the master server and can be queried as well.

```
$ dig @172.17.0.3 www.acme-inc.com +short
srv001.acme-inc.com.
172.17.1.1
```

The script `docker-tests/functional-tests.sh` will run a [BATS](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) test suite, `dns.bats` that performs a number of different queries. Specify the server IP address as the environment variable `${SUT_IP}` (short for System Under Test).

```
$ SUT_IP=172.17.0.2 ./docker-tests/functional-tests.sh

### Running Vagrant tests

1. Fetch the tests branch: `git fetch origin vagrant-tests`
2. Create a Git worktree for the test code: `git worktree add vagrant-tests vagrant-tests`. This will create a directory `vagrant-tests/`.
3. `cd vagrant-tests/`
4. `vagrant up` will then create two VMs and apply a test playbook (`test.yml`).

The command `vagrant up` results in a setup with *two* DNS servers, a master and a slave, set up according to playbook `test.yml`.

| **Hostname**     | **ip**        |
| :---             | :---          |
| `testbindmaster` | 192.168.56.53 |
| `testbindslave`  | 192.168.56.54 |

IP addresses are in the subnet of the default VirtualBox Host Only network interface (192.168.56.0/24). You should be able to query the servers from your host system. For example, to verify if the slave is updated correctly, you can do the following:

```ShellSession
$ dig @192.168.56.54 ns1.example.com +short
testbindmaster.example.com.
192.168.56.53
$ dig @192.168.56.54 example.com www.example.com +short
web.example.com.
192.168.56.20
192.168.56.21
$ dig @192.168.56.54 MX example.com +short
10 mail.example.com.

```

An automated acceptance test written in [BATS](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats.git) is provided that checks most settings specified in `vagrant-tests/test.yml`. You can run it by executing the shell script `vagrant-tests/runtests.sh`. The script can be run on either your host system (assuming you have a Bash shell), or one of the VMs. The script will download BATS if needed and run the test script `vagrant-tests/dns.bats` on both the master and the slave DNS server.

```ShellSession
$ cd vagrant-tests
$ vagrant up
[...]
$ ./runtests.sh
