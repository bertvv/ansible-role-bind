# Ansible role `bind`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bertvv/ansible-role-bind.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bertvv/ansible-role-bind)

An Ansible role for setting up BIND ISC as an **authoritative-only** DNS server for multiple domains. Specifically, the responsibilities of this role are to:

- install BIND
- set up the main configuration file
    - master server
    - slave server
- set up forward and reverse lookup zone files

This role supports multiple forward and reverse zones, including for IPv6. Although enabling recursion is supported (albeit *strongly* discouraged), consider using another role if you want to set up a caching or forwarding name server.

Configuring the firewall is not a concern of this role, so you should do this using another role (e.g. [bertvv.rh-base](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/rh-base/)).

If you like/use this role, please consider giving it a star and rating it on the role's [Ansible Galaxy page](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/bind). Thanks!

See the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) for notable changes between versions.

## Supported platforms

This role can be used on several platforms, see [meta/main.yml](meta/main.yml) for an updated list. We strive to set up automated tests for each supported platform (see [.travis.yml](.travis.yml)), but this is not always possible.

A few remarks on supported roles that are not included in automated tests

- **Arch Linux** should work, but at this time, it's not possible to test the role on this distro.
- The same goes for **FreeBSD**.
- **CentOS 6** should work, but idempotence tests fail (at the time of the release of v4.2.0 of this role), even if BIND is installed correctly and acceptance tests succeed.
- **Ubuntu 16.04** should also work, but automated tests on Travis CI result in a timeout (at the time of the release of v4.2.0 of this role), while succeeding in a local test environment.

## Requirements

- **The package `python-ipaddr` should be installed on the management node** (since v3.7.0)

## Role Variables

† Best practice for an authoritative name server is to leave recursion turned off. However, [for some cases](http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch7/queries.html#allow-query-cache) it may be necessary to have recursion turned on.

### Minimal variables for a working zone

Even though only variable `bind_zone_master_server_ip` is required for the role to run without errors, this is not sufficient to get a working zone. In order to set up an authoritative name server that is available to clients, you should also at least define the following variables:

| Variable                     | Master | Slave |
| :---                         | :---:  | :---: |
| `bind_zone_domains`          | V      | V     |
| `- name`                     | V      | V     |
| `- networks`                 | V      | V     |
| `- name_servers`             | V      | --    |
| `- hosts`                    | V      | --    |
| `bind_listen_ipv4`           | V      | V     |
| `bind_allow_query`           | V      | V     |

### Domain definitions

```Yaml
bind_zone_domains:
  - name: mydomain.com           # Domain name
    create_reverse_zones: false  # Skip creation of reverse zones
    hosts:
      - name: pub01
        ip: 192.0.2.1
        ipv6: 2001:db8::1
        aliases:
          - ns
      - name: '@'                # Enables "http://mydomain.com/"
        ip:
          - 192.0.2.2            # Multiple IP addresses for a single host
          - 192.0.2.3            #   results in DNS round robin
        sshfp:                   # Secure shell fingerprint
          - "3 1 1262006f9a45bb36b1aa14f45f354b694b77d7c3"
          - "3 2 e5921564252fe10d2dbafeb243733ed8b1d165b8fa6d5a0e29198e5793f0623b"
        ipv6:
          - 2001:db8::2
          - 2001:db8::3
        aliases:
          - www
      - name: priv01             # This IP is in another subnet, will result in
        ip: 10.0.0.1             #   multiple reverse zones
      - name: mydomain.net.
        aliases:
          - name: sub01
            type: DNAME          # Example of a DNAME alias record
    networks:
      - '192.0.2'
      - '10'
      - '172.16'
    delegate:
      - zone: foo
        dns: 192.0.2.1
    services:
      - name: _ldap._tcp
        weight: 100
        port: 88
        target: dc001
    naptr:                       # Name Authority Pointer record, used for IP
      - name: "sip"              #   telephony
        order: 100
        pref: 10
        flags: "S"
        service: "SIP+D2T"
        regex: "!^.*$!sip:customer-service@example.com!"
        replacement: "_sip._tcp.example.com."
```

### Minimal slave configuration

```Yaml
    bind_listen_ipv4: ['any']
    bind_allow_query: ['any']
    bind_zone_master_server_ip: 192.168.111.222
    bind_zone_domains:
      - name: example.com
```

### Hosts

Host names that this DNS server should resolve can be specified in `hosts` as a list of dicts with fields `name`, `ip`,  `aliases` and `sshfp`. Aliases can be CNAME (default) or DNAME records.

To allow to surf to `http://example.com/`, set the host name of your web server to `'@'` (must be quoted!). In BIND syntax, `@` indicates the domain name itself.

If you want to specify multiple IP addresses for a host, add entries to `bind_zone_hosts` with the same name (e.g. `priv01` in the code snippet). This results in multiple A/AAAA records for that host and allows [DNS round robin](http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch9/rr.html), a simple load balancing technique. The order in which the IP addresses are returned can be configured with role variable `bind_rrset_order`.

### Networks

As you can see, not all hosts are in the same network. This is perfectly acceptable, and supported by this role. All networks should be specified in `networks` (part of bind_zone_domains.name dict), though, or the host will not get a PTR record for reverse lookup:

Remark that only the network part should be specified here! When specifying a class B IP address (e.g. "172.16") in a variable file, it must be quoted. Otherwise, the Yaml parser will interpret it as a float.

Based on the idea and examples detailed at <https://linuxmonk.ch/wordpress/index.php/2016/managing-dns-zones-with-ansible/> for the gdnsd package, the zonefiles are fully idempotent, and thus only get updated if "real" content changes.

### Zone delgation

To delegate a zone to a DNS, it is enough to create a `NS` record (under delegate) which is the equivalent of:

```text
foo IN NS 192.0.2.1
```

### Service records

Service (SRV) records can be added with the services. This should be a list of dicts with mandatory fields `name` (service name), `target` (host providing the service), `port` (TCP/UDP port of the service) and optional fields `priority` (default = 0) and `weight` (default = 0).

### ACLs

ACLs can be defined like this:

```Yaml
bind_acls:
  - name: acl1
    match_list:
      - 192.0.2.0/24
      - 10.0.0.0/8
```

The names of the ACLs will be added to the `allow-transfer` clause in global options.

### Binding Keys

Binding keys can be defined like this:

```Yaml
bind_dns_keys:
  - name: master_key
    algorithm: hmac-sha256
    secret: "azertyAZERTY123456"
bind_extra_include_files:
  - "{{ bind_auth_file }}"
```

**tip**: Extra include file must be set as an ansible variable because file is OS dependant

This will be set in a file *"{{ bind_auth_file }}* (e.g. /etc/bind/auth_transfer.conf for debian) which have to be added in the list variable **bind_extra_include_files**

## Dependencies

No dependencies.

## Example Playbook

See the test playbook [converge.yml](molecule/default/converge.yml) for an elaborate example that showcases most features.

## Testing

This role is tested using [Ansible Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/). Tests are launched automatically on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/bertvv/ansible-role-bind) after each commit and PR.

This Molecule configuration will:

- Run Yamllint and Ansible Lint
- Create two Docker containers, one primary (`ns1`) and one secondary (`ns2`) DNS server
- Run a syntax check
- Apply the role with a [test playbook](molecule/default/converge.yml)
- Run acceptance tests with [BATS](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core/)

This process is repeated for the supported Linux distributions.

### Local test environment

If you want to set up a local test environment, you can use this reproducible setup based on Vagrant+VirtualBox: <https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-testenv>. Steps to install the necessary tools manually:

1. Docker and BATS should be installed on your machine (assumed to run Linux). No Docker containers should be running when you start the test.
2. As recommended by Molecule, create a python virtual environment
3. Install the software tools `python3 -m pip install molecule docker netaddr yamllint ansible-lint`
4. Navigate to the root of the role directory and run `molecule test`

Molecule automatically deletes the containers after a test. If you would like to check out the containers yourself, run `molecule converge` followed by `molecule login --host HOSTNAME`.

The Docker containers are based on images created by [Jeff Geerling](https://hub.docker.com/u/geerlingguy), specifically for Ansible testing (look for images named `geerlingguy/docker-DISTRO-ansible`). You can use any of his images, but only the distributions mentioned in [meta/main.yml](meta/main.yml) are supported.

The default config will start two Centos 7 containers (the primary supported platform at this time). Choose another distro by setting the `MOLECULE_DISTRO` variable with the command, e.g.:

``` bash
MOLECULE_DISTRO=debian9 molecule test
```

or

``` bash
MOLECULE_DISTRO=debian9 molecule converge
```

You can run the acceptance tests on both servers with `molecule verify` or manually with

```console
SUT_IP=172.17.0.2 bats molecule/default/files/dns.bats
```

You need to initialise the variable `SUT_IP`, the system under test's IP address. The primary server, `ns1`, should have IP address 172.17.0.2 and the secondary server, `ns2` 172.17.0.3.
