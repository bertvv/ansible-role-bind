# Ansible role `bind`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bertvv/ansible-role-bind.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bertvv/ansible-role-bind)

An Ansible role for setting up BIND ISC as an **authoritative-only** DNS server for multiple domains on EL7 or Ubuntu Server. Specifically, the responsibilities of this role are to:

- install BIND
- set up the main configuration file
    - master server
    - slave server
- set up forward and reverse lookup zone files

This role supports multiple forward and reverse zones, including for IPv6. Although enabling recursion is supported (albeit *strongly* discouraged), consider using another role if you want to set up a caching or forwarding name server.

Configuring the firewall is not a concern of this role, so you should do this using another role (e.g. [bertvv.rh-base](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/rh-base/)).

If you like/use this role, please consider giving it a star. Thanks!

See the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) for notable changes between versions.

## Requirements

- **The package `python-ipaddr` should be installed on the management node** (since v3.7.0)

â€  Best practice for an authoritative name server is to leave recursion turned off. However, [for some cases](http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch7/queries.html#allow-query-cache) it may be necessary to have recursion turned on.

### Minimal variables for a working zone

Even though only variable `bind_zone_master_server_ip` is required for the role to run without errors, this is not sufficient to get a working zone. In order to set up an authoritative name server that is available to clients, you should also at least define the following variables:

| Variable                     | Master | Slave |
| :---                         | :---:  | :---: |
| `bind_zone_domains`          | V      | V     |
| `  - name`                   | V      | V     |
| `  - networks`               | V      | --    |
| `  - name_servers`           | V      | --    |
| `  - hosts`                  | V      | --    |
| `bind_listen_ipv4`           | V      | V     |
| `bind_allow_query`           | V      | V     |

### Domain definitions

      - name: pub01
        ip: 192.0.2.1
        ipv6: 2001:db8::1
        aliases:
          - ns
      - name: '@'
        ip:
          - 192.0.2.2
          - 192.0.2.3
        ipv6:
          - 2001:db8::2
          - 2001:db8::3
        aliases:
          - www
      - name: priv01
        ip: 10.0.0.1
    networks:
      - '192.0.2'
      - '10'
      - '172.16'
    delegate:
      - zone: foo
        dns: 192.0.2.1
    services:
      - name: _ldap._tcp
        weight: 100
        port: 88
        target: dc001
```

### Minimal slave configuration

```Yaml
    bind_listen_ipv4: ['any']
    bind_allow_query: ['any']
    bind_zone_master_server_ip: 192.168.111.222
    bind_zone_domains:
      - name: example.com
```

### Hosts

Host names that this DNS server should resolve can be specified in `hosts` as a list of dicts with fields `name`, `ip` and `aliases`

To allow to surf to http://example.com/, set the host name of your web server to `'@'` (must be quoted!). In BIND syntax, `@` indicates the domain name itself.

If you want to specify multiple IP addresses for a host, add entries to `bind_zone_hosts` with the same name (e.g. `priv01` in the code snippet). This results in multiple A/AAAA records for that host and allows [DNS round robin](http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch9/rr.html), a simple load balancing technique. The order in which the IP addresses are returned can be configured with role variable `bind_rrset_order`.

### Networks

As you can see, not all hosts are in the same network. This is perfectly acceptable, and supported by this role. All networks should be specified in `networks` (part of bind_zone_domains.name dict), though, or the host will not get a PTR record for reverse lookup:

Remark that only the network part should be specified here! When specifying a class B IP address (e.g. "172.16") in a variable file, it must be quoted. Otherwise, the Yaml parser will interpret it as a float.

Based on the idea and examples detailed at <https://linuxmonk.ch/wordpress/index.php/2016/managing-dns-zones-with-ansible/> for the gdnsd package, the zonefiles are fully idempotent, and thus only get updated if "real" content changes.

### Zone delgation

To delegate a zone to a DNS, it is enough to create a `NS` record (under delegate) which is the equivalent of:

```
foo IN NS 192.0.2.1
```

### Service records

Service (SRV) records can be added with the services. Tis should be a list of dicts with mandatory fields `name` (service name), `target` (host providing the service), `port` (TCP/UDP port of the service) and optional fields `priority` (default = 0) and `weight` (default = 0).

### ACLs

ACLs can be defined like this:

```Yaml
bind_acls:
  - name: acl1
    match_list:
      - 192.0.2.0/24
      - 10.0.0.0/8
```

The names of the ACLs will be added to the `allow-transfer` clause in global options if bind_views is not defined.

ACLs can also be paired with TSIG keys as a way to control access to views:

```Yaml
bind_acls:
  - name: external_key
    match_list:
      - "!key internal.example.com"
      - "key external.example.com"
  - name: internal_key
    match_list:
      - "!key external.example.com"
      - "key internal.example.com"
```

### Transaction Signature (TSIG) keys

```Yaml
bind_keys:
  - name: rndc-key
    algorithm: hmac-md5
    secret: "+Cdjlkef9ZTSeixERZ433Q=="
```

The key secret is a security credential and should be protected as a variable encrypted with ansible-vault.

```Yaml
bind_keys:
  - name: rndc-key
    algorithm: hmac-md5
    secret: "{{ vault_rndc_key_secret }}"
```

bind_keys defines global TSIG keys only. TSIG keys used by views must be defined within bind_views.

[NIST recommends using HMAC-SHA256 instead of HMAC-MD5 for the TSIG algorithm](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-81/2/final).

### Masters

Masters can be defined like this:

```Yaml
bind_masters:
  - name: EXTERNAL_MASTERS
    master_list:
      - address: 200.100.230.160
        tsig_key: external.example.com

  - name: INTERNAL_MASTERS
    master_list:
      - address: 192.168.8230.160

  - name: AKAMAI_ZTAS
    master_list:
      - address: 23.73.133.141
        tsig_key: external.example.com
      - address: 23.73.133.237
        tsig_key: external.example.com
      - address: 23.73.134.141
        tsig_key: external.example.com
      - address: 23.73.134.237
        tsig_key: external.example.com
```

The first two masters are masters server to get zone tranfers from.  The third master is a list of slaves, specifically Zone Transfer Agents (ZTAs) for Akamai's Fast DNS cloud DNS service.  Masters can be configured to require TSIG keys for access control instead of IP addresses.

### View definitions

```Yaml
bind_views:
  - name: EXTERNAL
    allow_query:
      - external_key
    allow_transfer:
      - external_key
    allow_notify:
      - external_key
    also_notify:
      - AKAMAI_ZTAS
    match_clients:
      - external_key
    match_destinations:
      - any
    match_recursive_only: false
    notify: explicit
    tsig_keys:
      - name: external.example.com
        algorithm: HMAC-SHA256
        secret: "{{ vault_external_secret }}"
    recursion: false

  - name: INTERNAL
    allow_query:
      - "!key external.example.com"
      - "key internal.example.com"
      - 192.168.20.20
      - 127.0.0.1
    allow_transfer:
      - "!key external.example.com"
      - "key internal.example.com"
    allow_notify:
      - "!key external.example.com"
      - "key internal.example.com"
    also_notify:
      - 192.168.12.12 
    match_clients:
      - "!key external.example.com"
      - "key internal.example.com"
      - 192.168.20.20
      - 127.0.0.1
    match_destinations:
      - any
    match_recursive_only: false
    notify: explicit
    tsig_keys:
      - name: internal.example.com
        algorithm: HMAC-SHA256
        secret: "{{ vault_internal_secret }}"
    recursion: false
```

Above are two common views, internal and external.  The external view controls access with TSIG keys defined previously as ACLs.  It also notifies the Akamai cloud DNS servers by its masters name after any zone changes.  The internal view controls access using TSIG keys and IP addresses and sends notifies by IP.  Each view has its own TSIG key.  [NIST recommends using HMAC-SHA256 as the TSIG algorithm](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-81/2/final)

### Minimal variables for a working zone with views

Even though only variable `bind_zone_master_server_ip` is required for the role to run without errors, this is not sufficient to get a working zone. In order to set up an authoritative name server that is available to clients, you should also at least define the following variables:

| Variable                     | Master | Slave |
| :---                         | :---:  | :---: |
| `bind_zone_domains`          | V      | V     |
| `  - name`                   | V      | V     |
| `  - view`                   | V      | V     |
| `  - networks`               | V      | --    |
| `  - name_servers`           | V      | --    |
| `  - hosts`                  | V      | --    |
| `bind_listen_ipv4`           | V      | V     |
| `bind_allow_query`           | V      | V     |

### Domain definitions for master with view and masters defined.

```Yaml
bind_zone_domains:
  - name: example.com
    view: EXTERNAL
    masters: EXTERNAL_MASTER
    hosts:
      - name: pub01
        ip: 192.0.2.1
        ipv6: 2001:db8::1
        aliases:
          - ns
      - name: '@'
        ip:
          - 192.0.2.2
          - 192.0.2.3
        ipv6:
          - 2001:db8::2
          - 2001:db8::3
        aliases:
          - www
      - name: priv01
        ip: 10.0.0.1
    networks:
      - '192.0.2'
      - '10'
      - '172.16'
    delegate:
      - zone: foo
        dns: 192.0.2.1
    services:
      - name: _ldap._tcp
        weight: 100
        port: 88
        target: dc001
```

This domain is configured for the EXTERNAL view.  It will use the masters configuration named EXTERNAL_MASTERS instead of the bind_zone_master_server_ip value.

### Domain definition for slave with view and masters defined. 

```Yaml
bind_zone_domains: [
  { name: example.com, view: EXTERNAL, masters: EXTERNAL_MASTERS },
  { name: test.com, view: EXTERNAL, masters: EXTERNAL_MASTERS },
  { name: example.com, view: INTERNAL },
  { name: test.com, view: INTERNAL }
]
```

## Dependencies

No dependencies. If you want to configure the firewall, do this through another role (e.g. [bertvv.rh-base](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/rh-base)).

## Example Playbook

See the test playbook [test.yml](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-bind/blob/docker-tests/test.yml) for an elaborate example that showcases most features.

## Testing

There are two test environments for this role, one based on Vagrant, the other on Docker. The latter powers the Travis-CI tests. The tests are kept in a separate (orphan) branch so as not to clutter the actual code of the role. [git-worktree(1)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) is used to include the test code into the working directory. Remark that this requires at least Git v2.5.0.

### Running Docker tests

1. Fetch the test branch: `git fetch origin docker-tests`
2. Create a Git worktree for the test code: `git worktree add docker-tests docker-tests`. This will create a directory `docker-tests/`

The script `docker-tests.sh` will create a Docker container, and apply this role from a playbook `test.yml`. The Docker images are configured for testing Ansible roles and are published at <https://hub.docker.com/r/bertvv/ansible-testing/>. There are images available for several distributions and versions. The distribution and version should be specified outside the script using environment variables:

```
DISTRIBUTION=centos VERSION=7 ./docker-tests/docker-tests.sh
```

The specific combinations of distributions and versions that are supported by this role are specified in `.travis.yml`.

The first time the test script is run, a container will be created that is assigned the IP address 172.17.0.2. This will be the master DNS-server. The server is still running after the script finishes and can be queried from the command line, e.g.:

```
$ dig @172.17.0.2 www.acme-inc.com +short
srv001.acme-inc.com.
172.17.1.1
```

If you run the script again, a new container is launched with IP address 172.17.0.3 that will be set up as a slave DNS-server. After a few seconds, it will have received updates from the master server and can be queried as well.

```
$ dig @172.17.0.3 www.acme-inc.com +short
srv001.acme-inc.com.
172.17.1.1
```

The script `docker-tests/functional-tests.sh` will run a [BATS](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) test suite, `dns.bats` that performs a number of different queries. Specify the server IP address as the environment variable `${SUT_IP}` (short for System Under Test).

```
$ SUT_IP=172.17.0.2 ./docker-tests/functional-tests.sh
### Using BATS executable at: /usr/local/bin/bats

```

### Running Vagrant tests

1. Fetch the tests branch: `git fetch origin vagrant-tests`
2. Create a Git worktree for the test code: `git worktree add vagrant-tests vagrant-tests`. This will create a directory `vagrant-tests/`.
3. `cd vagrant-tests/`
4. `vagrant up` will then create two VMs and apply a test playbook (`test.yml`).

The command `vagrant up` results in a setup with *two* DNS servers, a master and a slave, set up according to playbook `test.yml`.

| **Hostname**     | **ip**        |
| :---             | :---          |
| `testbindmaster` | 192.168.56.53 |
| `testbindslave`  | 192.168.56.54 |

IP addresses are in the subnet of the default VirtualBox Host Only network interface (192.168.56.0/24). You should be able to query the servers from your host system. For example, to verify if the slave is updated correctly, you can do the following:

```ShellSession
$ dig @192.168.56.54 ns1.example.com +short
testbindmaster.example.com.
192.168.56.53
$ dig @192.168.56.54 example.com www.example.com +short
web.example.com.
192.168.56.20
192.168.56.21
$ dig @192.168.56.54 MX example.com +short
10 mail.example.com.

```

An automated acceptance test written in [BATS](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats.git) is provided that checks most settings specified in `vagrant-tests/test.yml`. You can run it by executing the shell script `vagrant-tests/runtests.sh`. The script can be run on either your host system (assuming you have a Bash shell), or one of the VMs. The script will download BATS if needed and run the test script `vagrant-tests/dns.bats` on both the master and the slave DNS server.

```ShellSession
$ cd vagrant-tests
$ vagrant up
[...]
$ ./runtests.sh
