## 4.2.0 - 2020-05-23

An update that's been long overdue. Several PRs with new features were merged!

A special thanks to @blofeldthefish for his willingness to help out with maintaining this role and to @RobinsOphalvens for contributing the new testing harness based on Molecule. Thanks to them, further development of this role got out of the deadlock it's been in since the previous version.

## Added

- New supported platforms
    - CentOS 8 (GH-107, credit: [Paulius Mazeika](https://github.com/pauliusm))
    - Debian 10 (no changes were needed)
    - FreeBSD (GH-100, credit: [psa](https://github.com/psa))
    - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (no changes were needed)
- (GH-69) Allow TTLs for individual records (credit: [Stuart Knight](https://github.com/blofeldthefish))
- (GH-79) Added support for the SSHFP record type (credit: [Romuald](https://github.com/rds13))
- (GH-81) Added support for the DNAME record type (credit: [B. Verschueren](https://github.com/bverschueren))
- (GH-82) Added support for the NAPTR record type (credit: [Aido](https://github.com/aido))
- (GH-83) Added support for the [`$GENERATE` directive](http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch8/generate.html) (credit: [Rayford Johnson](https://github.com/rayfordj))
- (GH-85) New role variable `bind_other_logs` (credit: [Paulo E. Castro](https://github.com/pecastro))
- (GH-87) New role variable `bind_dns_keys`, a list of binding keys (credit: [Jérôme Avond](https://github.com/jadjay))
- (GH-88) New role variable `bind_statistics_channels` (credit: [Stuart Knight](https://github.com/blofeldthefish))
- (GH-105, GH-113) New role variable `bind_query_log`, with more flexibility w.r.t. query logging (credit: [Romuald](https://github.com/rds13) and [Jascha Sticher](https://github.com/itbane))
- New keys in `bind_zone_domains`: `create_forward_zones` and `create_reverse_zones`. When present and set to false, they will prevent the creation of the forward or reverse zones, respectively. This results in a reverse only or forward only name server for that zone.

## Changed

- Molecule is now used as testing harness (credit: [Robin Ophalvens](https://github.com/RobinOphalvens)). The previous system was written before any standardised testing tools were available. It became too cumbersome to maintain, which had serious impact on the further development of this role.
- (GH-75) Refactored hash gathering to determine if zone files need to be regenerated (credit: [Stuart Knight](https://github.com/blofeldthefish))
- (GH-89) Add missing `allow-recursion` parameter for bind slaves, allowing them to handle recursion correctly (credit: [Lennart Weller](https://github.com/lhw))

- (GH-99) Use `bind_group` variable instead of hard-coded value (credit: [Boris Momčilović](https://github.com/kornrunner))
- (GH-114,115) Fix error with scenario in conjunction with a dhcp shared secret key to provide dynamic dns updates. (credit: [Fabio Rocha](https://github.com/frock81))

## 4.1.0 - 2018-10-05

## 4.0.0 - 2018-05-19

### Added

- (GH-50) Add support for multiple zones (credit: [Stuart Knight](https://github.com/blofeldthefish)). **This is a breaking change,** as it changes the syntax for specifying zones.

- (GH-32, GH-33) Fix for bug where CNAMEs and Multi-IP entries weren't working (credit: [Greg Cockburn](https://github.com/gergnz))

## 3.7.1 - 2017-07-03

### Changed

- (GH-29) Zone files are fully idempotent, so are only changed when actual content changes (credit: [@Stuart Knight](https://github.com/blofeldthefish))

## 3.7.0 - 2017-06-01

### Added

- (GH-10) Implement reverse IPv6 lookups
- (GH-28) Add option `bind_forwarders` and `bind_forward_only`, which allows BIND to be set up as a caching name server.

## 3.6.1 - 2017-06-01

### Changed

- Fixed a bug with generating the reverse zone names.

## 3.6.0 - 2017-06-01

### Changed

- (GH-25) Allow slave log file to be set with variable `bind_log` instead of a hard coded value (credit @kartone).
- The alignment of columns in the reverse zone file are improved

### Added

- (GH-22, 23) Documentation improvements
- (GH-27) Allow dynamic updates (credit: @bverschueren)

### Removed

- The custom filter plugins were removed. The functionality has since been added to Ansible's built-in filter plugins. This does require `python-netaddr` to be installed on the management node.

## 3.5.2 - 2016-09-29

### Changed

* The call to `named-checkconf` was fixed. It had the full path to the binary, which is not the same on all distributions. (GH-20, credit @peterjanes)

## 3.5.1 - 2016-09-22

### Changed

* The check for master/slave server is improved (GH-19, credit @josetaas)

## 3.5.0 - 2016-07-28

### Added

* Introduced role variable `bind_log`, the path to the log file.
* Introduced role variable `bind_zone_also_notify`, a list of servers that will receive a notification when the master zone file is reloaded (GH-18, credit: Joanna Delaporte)
* Reverse zone files now handle the case with only a single host (GH-18, credit: Joanna Delaporte)

## 3.4.0 - 2016-05-26

### Added

* (GH-16) Support for service record (SRV) lookups
* Support for text record (TXT) lookups

### Changed

* Fixed Ansible 2.0 deprecation warnings
* Generating a serial is no longer considered a change
* Ensured that all role variables have a default value, e.g. empty list instead of undefined. This simplifies template logic (no `if defined` tests), and is considered [deprecated in playbooks within a *with_* loop](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/porting_guide_2.0.html#deprecated).

## 3.3.1 - 2016-04-08

### Removed

* The `version:` field in `meta/main.yml`. This an unofficial field that is used by a third-party tool for managing role dependencies (librarian-ansible). Custom meta fields are no longer accepted in Ansible 2.0. See [ansible/ansible#13496](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/13496) for more info. Unfortunately, this will break support for librarian-ansible. As a workaround, until this issue is resolved upstream, use version 3.3.0 of this role.

## 3.3.0 - 2016-04-08

### Added

* Added role variable `bind_other_name_servers` for adding NS records for DNS servers outside of the domain. (GH-12)
* Re-added `bind_recursion`, as it is needed in some cases. (GH-14)

### Removed

## 3.2.1 - 2015-12-15

### Added

* The domain name can now also point to an IP address, enabling e.g. "http://example.com/" (GH-11)

## 3.2.0 - 2015-12-07

### Added

* Add support for multiple IP addresses per host (GH-9)
* Allow setting `rrset-order` (for DNS round robin)
* Add support for (multiple) IPv6 (AAAA) records (GH-2). For now, only forward lookups are supported.

### Changed

* Test code is put into a separate branch. This means that test code is no longer included when installing the role from Ansible Galaxy.

## 3.1.0 - 2015-12-04

### Added

* Add support for zone transfers (GH-8)
* Check whether `bind_zone_master_server_ip` was set (GH-7)

### Removed

* Role variable `bind_recursion` was removed. This role is explicitly only suitable for an authoritative DNS server, and in this case, recursion should be off.

## 3.0.0 - 2015-06-14

### Added

* You can now set up a master and slave DNS server.
* The variable `bind_zone_master_server_ip` was added. This is a **required** variable, which makes this release not backwards compatible.
* Automated acceptance tests for the test playbook

## 2.0.0 - 2015-06-10

### Added

* Added EL6 to supported platforms. Thanks to @rilindo for verifying this.

### Changed

* Recursion is turned off by default, which fits an authoritative name server. This change is not backwards compatible, as the behaviour of BIND is different from before when you do not set the variable `bind_recursion` explicitly.

### Removed

* Firewall settings. This should not be a concern of this role. Configuring the firewall is functionality offered by other roles (e.g. [bertvv.bind](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-el7))

## 1.0.0 - 2015-04-22

First release!

### Added

- Functionality for master DNS server
- Multiple reverse lookup zones
